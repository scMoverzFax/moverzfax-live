				<h2 class="text-center mb-5" style="font-weight: 500">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
				<p class="p_q">How does MoverZfax rate a company? TEST TEST TEST</p>
				<p>We use complex algorithms that require tricky calculations. I guess it might easier to understand how Google ranks you on their page than understanding ours. We rate our company in %s, not like an A or anything of that sort. We feel %s give a better idea of how to select the mover than the standard letter rating. Also, a mover that is rated above 80% is recommended.</p>
				<p class="p_q">Does it really cost ONLY $5?</p>
				<p>Yes, it does. The sole purpose of MoverZfax is to eliminate rogue/scam movers from the market. Here it is, I said it. The United States Department of Transportation hasnt succeeded in that task yet; so, we decided to jump in and help. If everyone who needs to move orders the report prior to selecting a moving company, then all scam movers will NO longer be in operation because no one will ever use their services due to a bad rating/reputation. Whatever way we can help to complete this task successfully, we will be happy with the result. You can also order the report for a friend who can't navigate the Internet. Spread the word, and imagine that for the price of a beer, you can save your furniture from being taken hostage by a rogue mover. Not bad of a deal is it?</p>
				<p class="p_q">How detailed is the report?</p>
				<p>As I said, we dig so deep that we get to the core of the mover's existence. Many rogue movers might not want to be registered with us because we are so detailed. Prior to using a company, you can ask them: Show me the MoverZfax report. For companies who hesitate, I would suggest NOT to do business with them. However, you can also get the report yourself which might end up saving you thousands of dollars, headaches, heartaches, frustration, anger, and much more, just for the mere price of $5.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="p_h">UNDERSTANDING YOUR MOVERZFAX REPORT</p>
				<p class="p_q">How to read my report?</p>
				<p>The report is based on several criteria or I would say categories so you can find information about their legal status, what moving association they are members of, all of their online reviews, a portal where you can file complaints if needed to your local authority, and of course, the Summary. The Summary is a grade that is based on all recommendations grouped together so our algorithm can tally up the results and give a grade based on % points. We make sure that all grades are fair, and since we base ourselves on recommendations from the outside Web, and a bit from the inside of MoverZfax, our results are logical and just. The general information tab of the report is to make sure the company information is legitimate, and not a DBA (doing business as). Some Rogue moving companies can operate under a different name to confuse the customer if legal actions are considered. Always use a company that has the actual name they operate with as their registered name with the state or federal government. Also, the USDOT and MC# can be of great help to track down the real entity of the company.</p>
				<p class="p_q">What are MoverZfax safety and reliability reports?</p>
				<p>To be called a moving company, you need to actually be on the road and driving from point A to point B with furniture in the back and make sure to deliver it safely and professionally (unless you deal with a scam movers where everything is broken or your furniture taken hostage). So, being on the road might result in accidents or crashes, or a broken down truck. Now a broken down truck is common; every honest moving company have had that happen in the past, even if you have a good maintenance schedule for the truck. The mechanics are complicated, hence, theres a great possibility of issues with the tractor-trailer. Now, if you have lots of crashes, then some questions have to be answered as to why these accidents happened. Our website provides all that to you. If most of their staff are drunk at the jobsite, and drive under the influence, then YES, there will be accidents, and possibly even deaths. All report will have a detailed safety and reliability report about the moving company.</p>
				<p class="p_q">Where does MoverZfax get the data to prepare reports of that magnitude and detail?</p>
				<p>This is where our research department gets together around a very comfortable couch and searches for the tiniest needle in the haystack. The results show why, where, how and when a moving company has acted unprofessionally, why they aren't registered with the state, why have they had tons of complaints at BBB, why they arent registered here or there. Imagine you owe money to the IRS. Don't think about ignoring them; they WILL come after you. They will not stop or let go; they will continue until you surrender the money. They are like the Terminator. Well, we are here to Terminate scam movers from the market by being vigilant in our research. We give you, our customer, the best report you will ever find on the Internet about a moving company. Our $5 report will save you hours and hours to find the information you need. Let us do it for you for the price of a beer. Our data is gathered from hundreds of places around the Web, from links that just a few can access because they are practically phantom links. We know where to find them, and we give you that information on a silver platter.</p>
				<p class="p_q">Does MoverZfax give the same quality information about other businesses?</p>
				<p>We ONLY tackle the moving industry. This industry is already filled with bad businesses that we can't really go outside our spectrum. We focus on one industry, and we stay pretty busy with that one. We make sure to always our system so new information always comes in about the mover. The information you get the day before might slightly change tomorrow. However, once you order the report, you can go into your account and re-download the report for FREE with d information about the moving company. We understand how things can change quickly. However, if a company has horrible reviews yesterday, there is a big chance the bad reviews will still be there tomorrow.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="p_h">HOW TO ORDER THE MOVERZFAX REPORT</p>
				<p class="p_q">If I need more than one report on moving companies, what will be the total cost?</p>
				<p>Like any smart shopper, you always look to compare prices and deals. So, we decided to make it more appealing when it comes to searching for companies and selecting the right one. Your first report will be $5; the second goes down to $4; the third to $3; the fourth to $2; and, the fifth and final goes to $1. However, when it comes to moving companies, we have the tendency to look for no more than 3 or 4 companies and make our choice. We will help you in finding the right one from the beginning.</p>
				<p class="p_q">What is the best way to find the moving companies prior to ordering reports about the specific mover?</p>
				<p>Thats a very good question. Here is the scenario: Companies A, B, C, D, and E are each giving a quote for a move from Washington, DC to Florida. Company A charges $4,000 dollars, based on your linear footage (NEVER GO WITH AN ESTIMATE BASED ON THE WEIGHT, ANOTHER INGREDIENT FOR DISASTER). Company B charges $12,000. Company C charges $7,500 . Company D charges $9,000;, and Company E charges $8,200. Now, the rule of thumb is: Add all quotes together: 4000 12000 7500 9000 8200=40700/5= $8140.
					I would then suggest you taking all quotes around the $8,200 mark. Choose the $7,500, the $8,200 and the $9,000, and then get the reports on all three of them. If you follow this rule, you can't go wrong.</p>
				<p class="p_q">If I can't afford 5 dollars for a report, what are my next options?</p>
				<p>Well, if you can't afford the report, you can't really afford a mover. However, if you choose to research the moving company reputation by yourself, on our home page, MoverZfax.com, you will find all the links that provide websites where information is available. I am not sure how deep you can dig, but its a start. Good luck with that.</p>
				<p class="p_q">How many reports are available on MoverZfax?
				<p>
				<p>Unlimited. You can go and order as many reports as you wish. However, going more than 5 is not recommended. The reason is because we estimated, throughout the years of researching the moving companies, that consumers limit their choices to no more than 3 or 4 movers prior to making their choice. So, in retrospect, we decided to go up to 5 reports in our system and charge $1 for the fifth report because it is more symbolic than actually charging for that report.</p>
				<p class="p_q">How do I get charged?</p>
				<p>We use PayPal merchant solution for all transactions because it is what we call MICROPURCHASES. The reports are so cheap that this method was the best alternative we can use for payment processing. Also, many people from around the world are familiar with PayPal, hence, accustomed to sending or receiving money.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="p_h" >HOW TO UTILIZE YOUR ACCOUNT</p>
				<p class="p_q">How to login to my account to find the reports?</p>
				<p>Obviously, you first need to register. On the left section of the site, below the menu bar, you will see a section that says Member Login. Once you login, you have access to everything you need, including the ordered reports. Just select the moving company, press BuyNow and once the transaction is approved by PayPal, you will get the report in your email (PDF file) or on your Member Panel directly on the site.</p>
				<p class="p_q">How do I change password or email?</p>
				<p>All of this information will be on your account portal. Just login and you can change all other information from there. Make sure to always save that ID information so you don't lose these changes.</p>
				<p class="p_q">What is the MoverZfax Privacy policy?</p>
				<p>All the information we get for the reports is information searched all around the Web. We search based on licensing information, USDOT #, MC#, State information, etc.. Every moving company we research goes through a detailed autopsy of their involvement in the industry. There is nothing we can't or won't do to protect you, our customer, from these scam movers. We will provide you with detailed information so you can use it to make a fair and safe decision on the mover you choose. All this information is public and found all over the Web.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="p_h">TERMS / GLOSSARY</p>
				<p class="p_q">What is the difference between a weight-based estimate and linear foot estimate?</p>
				<p>Scam versus honest, respectively speaking. The weight based estimate is a definitely good way to scam you, the customer. A moving company comes to do an estimate for a long distance move. They give you their tariff 400M. They say the cost per pound, including discount, is $.72. Now, the mover will not come with a scale and weigh every item. They will give you a weight ticket at destination and tell you how many pounds you actually had in your load. What you don't know or can't do, is follow them to weigh station to see them weigh the truck. Hence, they can easily add cars to their trailer and make you pay for it. How can you prove that wrongdoing? You can't. So, you are stuck paying for someone's else load that is NOT yours. Got the idea? Now, a linear foot estimate is different. They say that the cost will be $1,500 for 15 linear feet in the truck. So, before the driver puts the bulkhead separator to split your belongings to not mix it with others, they will tell you to come in the truck, count the vertical bars, located at 6 feet from each other so you can see how many feet you actually occupied on that truck. A basic trailer is 53 feet long, maybe one additional foot here and there. So, there is a total of 9 vertical bars on that trailer (9 bars X6 feet distance between them=54 feet). If at origin, you buy 15 feet, your load cannot take more space at destination. Its against all logic, I must say. That is how Linear footage is the most honest way to get an estimate.</p>
				<p class="p_q">What are your rights and responsibilities before you move?</p>
				<p>You have lots of them. Just make sure you go to protectyourmove.gov and see your rights as a consumer. There are so many details to pay attention to. Do not hurry and take a mover at the last minute. You will regret that you did. Most scam movers take advantage of that when you call two days before to get a move done. Do not be a victim. Scam movers love people like that. They feed themselves on these individuals, like scavengers. Stay away from last minutes unless the mover you will be dealing with is a good referral. MoverZfax can help you through that last minute process by helping you get that right mover.</p>
				<p class="p_q">If I do get scammed, what are my resources to file complaints?</p>
				<p>MoverZfax does have a section for that, which is called Special Moving Task Force. You can go there and file complaints and we will help you through the process. Do it quickly after the incident. Do not wait too long. Talk with the company first to see if you can settle. Then, we can help you take action by contacting the proper authority, write the complaints, put you in contact with our legal team, basically do everything we can to take this mover out of business. You need to also realize that we need to hear both sides. It is not always the fault of the moving company. If you are the ONLY one complaining among thousands of very satisfied customers, we will need to determine the cause of the issue and see if the complaint is justifiable. Overall, MoverZfax is here to keep honest moving businesses IN business and eliminate the bad ones.</p>
				<p class="p_q">What are the industry trends?</p>
				<p>This information is available to the public. You can visit search Moving and Storage industry trends and full reports will be available FREE of charge. The American Moving and Storage industry provides valuable information regarding the industry overall. If you wonder how many movers are in our country, how many people it employs, the revenue it generates, amount of people who moves each year, including single and families. Remember, KNOWLEDGE is power. Get it as much as you possibly can (both knowledge and power)</p>
